[Synacor Challenge](https://challenge.synacor.com).

My attempt at solving the Synacor Challenge in OCaml.

Instructions:
- Building with `jbuilder build`.
- Run with `jbuilder exec synacor`.

TODO:
- Text adventure!
- Refactor VM operations to be more succinct.
- Refactor memory management to be saner.
